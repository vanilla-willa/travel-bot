# About
Chatbot to give user information about their travel lodging.
Inspired by my upcoming trip to China.
My first time making a functional chatbot. Had an similar idea for a hackathon 3-4 years ago scraping with an OpenStreetMap with BeautifulSoup to locate public water fountains, but it was not a functional app.
