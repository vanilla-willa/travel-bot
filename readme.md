# Facebook Messenger Bot
Python template using Flask to build webhook for Facebook's Messenger Bot API cloned from https://github.com/hartleybrody/fb-messenger-bot.

Tutorial from https://blog.hartleybrody.com/fb-messenger-bot/.

# About
Chatbot to give user information about their travel lodging by clicking on quick reply buttons.

Inspired by my upcoming trip to China.

(Not currently in production environment)

First time making a functional chatbot. Participated in a hackathon but was not functional, mostly conceptual.

# Future Iterations
Current iteration uses hard coded data in a nested dictionary structure.

Future iterations include using a linked list for conversation logic, implementing a greet button, supporting text replies instead of only quick replies.
